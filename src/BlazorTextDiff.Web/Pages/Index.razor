Mr. Fursley was the director of a firm called Brunings, which made hatchets. He was a big, well fed man with no neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Fursley was petite and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time bending over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Fursley's had a small son called Fudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret.
Their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
